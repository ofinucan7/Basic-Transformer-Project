hi you're on a rocket ship flying to the edge of the universe wait how big is the universe it's 1 + 2 * 99 * e plus 100 to the power of stop what the heck is going on here the universe is infinite Infinity can consist of numbers which are symbols that represent a value we can add these values we can subtract them and we can also do some strange things like this but we'll get to that later besides numbers there's also these things representing instructions relationships operations and Concepts signs and symbols some of these signs are inverses meaning that putting them together just make them want to undo each other or as the Nerds call it cancel each other this little fixed number right here is known as a constant and then there's also these unknown mysterious letters called variables one of them by themselves don't really tell us that much but put them together and now we have an equation like you know this one for example the goal of every equation is to get solved we do it by rearranging it in a way that isolates the variables from the constants think of it like this if we would like to solve this equation we would use the inverse operation to cancel out the constant on this side by doing that we've isolated the variable and thus gotten its value now there are also different types of equations there's the quadratic equation which always has one variable raised by no more than two and then there's also the polinomial equation which can have an unlimited amount of numbers their variables can be raised by meaning they can look like this sometimes these two are basically more hardcore versions of the linear equation which can't be raised by anything more than one a key thing to remember is that the variables in a quadratic and polinomial equation can be equal to multiple values at the same time to determine how many possible solutions an equation has we look at the largest number of variable in the equation is raised by X Cub - 3x = 0 for example will have these three solutions oh okay now that we know about these equations we need to you know actually be able to solve them these four formulas plus some extra methods pretty much explain step- by- step how looking at a quadratic equation we will see that it's basically the same as the first Formula if we then plug the number in the formula and then simplify we will then find out that the value X1 = -1 and X2 = -5 this is pretty neat but that's too complicated for us the second third and fourth formula tells us that we can rewrite these equations by factoring them into smaller parts we can then put each of them equal to zero and then solve them separately there is a Twist here though not every equation will be this simple they can also look like this which are close to impossible to factorize meaning if you're not smart enough to come up with your own formula you're going to have have to use this one instead now when it comes to the polom equation things can get weird except if you're four steps ahead and see that we actually can't factorize the equation and again solve each of them separately oh yeah did I mention that there's also equations that have a constant or as they say a base raised by a variable they're called exponential equations and tell us how a starting value grows or declines exponentially at a certain rate the base of the formula tells us the rate of growth or decline the constant tells us the initial value and the exponent tells us for how long it grows all right enough about equations let's get ourselves out of the atmosphere if you've ever been to space You' know that the earth looks like this oh sorry wrong picture you would know that the earth looks like this that my friend is a shape AKA a sphere there are two dimensional shapes fuse some of them together and now you got a three-dimensional shape now combine some of these and you have yourself this thing you see everything around you is just a bunch of shapes combined to make objects now let's say you wanted to know the size of this thing's surface or as most people call it the area first stretch the surfaces out which gives us a rectangle then measure the base and height and apply this formula area is measured in square units and every shape uses the base formula B * H actually that was kind of a lie the circle uses its radius square * pi but you get the idea now if we instead wanted to know how much we could stuff inside of an object we would need something called volume calculating how much candy you could fit inside of your cylindrical shaped bucket on Halloween could be pretty useful so in that case you would use this formula similar to area every shape pretty much uses the same base formula B which is the surface area of the base times the height with a few adjustments for each shape everyone except for you guessed it right the sphere again which now times pi by the radius squared hey want to see something cool said a man named Pythagoras almost 2,500 years ago as he formalized the Pythagorean theorem it tells us that this side called the hypotenuse in a right angle triangle equals the sum of the squares of the other two sides but that's freaking whack said this guy who 300 years later gave us a way to calculate the crazy relationship a triangle's angle has with its sides AKA trigonometry if we look at a triangle we will see this angle in trigonometry it's called Theta these sides have a particular ratio to one another based on the value of the angle Theta and are labeled hypotenuse opposite and adjacent there are three functions that pretty much sum up all of trigonometry actually there's one more thing too but we'll get to that later the sin function tells us the ratio between the opposite and the hypotenuse the coast function tells us the ratio between adjacent and the hypotenuse and the tan function tells us the ratio between opposite and the adjacent imagine a triangle with these values by using the sin function and then calculating it as an equation we can then find the value for x which equals 6.88 the other key thing to remember is this little circle divided into four quadrants with 12 points called a unit circle the points in the circle are defined by various measurements like for example degrees but the most common measurement however is radians which basically is the radius of the circle stretched out over its side creating an arc 6.28 3 radians make up a whole circle which is equal to the circumference of the circle 2 pi radius but since we only use radians as the measurement and not the radius we can rename 2 pi radius to 2 pi radians yeah I know they literally sound the same deal with it congratulations now that we know the circle in total is 2 pi radians we can also say that the points in our Circle become various fractions of pi over radians now here is when things get kind of freaky if we draw draw a line from the center of the circle this line according to trigonometry will have the unit one one what you may ask just one yeah you see since we're dealing with ratios between lengths they'll cancel each other out therefore we just use one if we know that this length is one unit long we can also figure out that the end of each axis have these coordinates now let's place this angle Theta in the circle and draw one line alongside the x-axis and then another one from the point where the angle intercepts the circle wait a minute that's the same triangle we drew earlier this side AKA the hypotenuse will have the unit one if we look at the functions sin Co and tan we can then plug our values into one of them and then simplify it do you see what's going on here we're marking out the coordinates for the angle Theta in simple terms we're figuring out the lengths of the triangle sides knowing this we can then say that the coordinates for the angle Theta are cos Theta comma sin Theta now to most normal people this tells us about as much as this kid trying to explain his dream so we're going to need some actual numbers the three key numbers to remember are square 3 over 2 square2 2 and square 1/ 2 which is simplified to 1/ 2 remember those dots in the circle representing the fractions of 2 pi radians turns out if we draw a right triangle with a 30° angle to pi/ 6 radians then draw a mirror image triangle below it we can then see that the length of the original line aka the wide coordinate AKA sin Theta = 1 2 you see there's a pattern here if we instead draw a triangle with a 45° angle to pi over 4 radians we will see indeed that sin Theta equal 2 / 2 doing the same with a triangle with the angle 60° to pk/ 3 radians will give us the conclusion that sin theta equals to square 3/ 2 long line big number medium line medium number Short Line small number and the same pattern applies to co Theta fun fact we can actually draw out the function of Co and sin in a graph it shows us the variation of Co and sin with respect to the angle Theta you can think of Co Theta as the xaxis when Theta increases so does the co Theta line until Theta goes over the second quadrant which sits on the negative side of cos Theta making the line slope down sin Theta pretty much does the same thing just in reverse all that talk about graphs and functions I think it's about time we talk about calculus using a function we can understand the change in motion in whatever your imagination can come up with this is f ofx and this is an equation put them together and then they become a function a function tells us that for a certain input X we get a certain output y to join the special Club of functions their inputs and outputs need to either have a onetoone relationship or a many to one relationship if we then plug all the input values and output values into a graph and then connect all the values with a line we will then get a longer line this line can tell us multiple things like for example this kid's heart rate when he realizes someone threw his diamond sword into lava functions come in multiple variant hey look those are the equations we looked at earlier depending on the equation the function FX equals you will get a certain type of line a linear function gives us a straight line where the constant tells us how much the output y increases in relation to the input X these lines can also get very bendy and can look like this or even this one thing many people confuse is that while these three lines might look similar they are vastly different the function of a quadratic equation will always have one turning point where it either turns up or down whereas the function of a polom equation will have multiple turning points fun fact the more variables you have in a function the more of these points you'll have not so fun fact this means a line can look like this okay but this graph doesn't it also have a turning point right there no that is an exponential function which as you know grows or declines exponentially meaning it won't at any point turn around speaking of points limits describe the behavior of a function as it approaches a specific point if you're not confused by that definition you're probably like four steps ahead but for the rest of us think of it as a point on a graph that when the line gets closer and closer to it it can start acting weird for example why don't you try to evaluate this function you can't because it equals zero which means we can't find out what the line does at xal 2 what we do instead is that we find out what it does as it approaches to aka the limit in this case we can then plug in a number that is just over two which then gives us 4.1 and to prove we're right we use a limit which gives us the number four now when we have a function that equals zero it becomes discontinuous continuous functions are functions that can be drawn without lifting the pencil of the paper AKA they won't have any holes or gaps that break its flow discontinuous functions which have the three states hole jump and INF in are the total opposite they couldn't think of anything worse than to stay in flow if you thought this was the limit when it comes to the usage of limits you were wrong they were also used to point out the Holy Grail of calculus or at least the second Holy Grail derivatives derivatives are used to calculate the rate of change and a function at a certain point if we zoom in on a function we can see that it's basically just a straight line now let's draw a line right here this is called a tangent and is the derivative of the original function now I'm sorry to disappoint you but getting the derivative isn't just zooming in on one line and drawing another let's say you have the function f ofx = 5x - 4 you would then have to plug everything into this formula by first replacing x with x + H and then divide everything with h simplify to then get the derivative 5 nah screw that said this guy who basically saved every future calculus student from getting an F by formalizing the power rule it's basically an idiot's guide to derivatives and tells us that the derivative of x raised to some power is equal to that number * X raised to the power of that number minus one for example X Cub when derived becomes 3x^2 and just X when derived becomes 1 and a constant derived is just completely canceled out now the crazy thing here is that you can actually derive the derivative of a function to get a function for the derivative and then you can derive that function to get a function of the derivative of a function of the derivative of a function of a function yeah okay that's cool and all but what if we have an exponential function where a constant is raised by a variable well then you would derive using the exponential rule you see there's also these things called the differentiation rules which gives us the formulas for how to derive much more complex functions like you know this one okay now let's say you would like to know the area of the surface under the function this is where we use the second Holy Grail of calculus integrals by slicing up the area under the line into an infinite amount of slices you can then calculate the area of each slice add them up and then get the whole area under the function now I know what you're thinking infinite rectangles isn't that like impossible technically yeah but not if we use an integral which gives us a really specific estimate of the area under the function as we approach an infinite number of squares this is the formula which is used by first deciding the intervals we want to calculate the area of and then we do something that literally can't stand derivatives so much they've named themselves anti-derivatives which are basically derivatives in Reverse 3x^2 for example is X cubed 6X anti- derived is 3x s eh yeah there's actually a problem here said some mathematicians since the derivative of a constant equals zero we wouldn't know if the anti-derivative has a constant now here is when an absolute genius came along and said what if we make the constants subtract each other out by adding this part of the integral formula and then boom we get the area hey want to play a game if you were on a train station and this weird guy came up to you with two pieces of paper what would be the chance of you being able to flip this little piece of paper on your first try well assuming that the game isn't completely rigged you would firstly have to calculate the amount of preferred outcomes then divided by the total number of possible outcomes and then you get the number 0.5 this means that there's a chance of 50% now there are two other key rules that you probably should remember the first one tells us that the probability of any event Must Fall somewhere between 0 and one with zero being something totally impossible and one being something 100% certain to happen the second rule tells us that if you were to add up all the probabilities of a certain event you would get the number one and the last one tells us that the probability of something happening plus the probability of it not happening is also equal to one anyways if you've been listening really well you should at this point be able to solve this mathematical problem now rumor goes that first person to comment the right answer gets a Shad outed in the next video so subscribe
